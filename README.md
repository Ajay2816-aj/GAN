# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate synthetic data that mimics a given dataset. GANs consist of two neural networks, the **Generator** and the **Discriminator**, that compete against each other to create realistic data.

## Features
- Implementation of GANs to generate images or other structured data.
- Support for datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, or custom datasets.
- Training and evaluation scripts with adjustable hyperparameters.
- Visualization of generated outputs during training.

## Requirements
To set up and run this project, you need:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `torch`
  - `torchvision`
  - `matplotlib`

## How It Works
1. **Generator**: Produces synthetic data from random noise (e.g., random vectors).
2. **Discriminator**: Distinguishes between real and synthetic data.
3. **Training Process**:
   - The generator tries to fool the discriminator into classifying synthetic data as real.
   - The discriminator learns to accurately classify real vs. synthetic data.
   - Both networks improve iteratively in an adversarial setting.

## Applications
- Image synthesis and super-resolution.
- Data augmentation.
- Video generation and editing.
- Generating realistic art or designs.

## Future Improvements
- Implement conditional GANs (CGANs) for labeled data.
- Integrate advanced GAN architectures like DCGAN, WGAN, or StyleGAN.
- Deploy trained models on cloud platforms for on-demand generation.
